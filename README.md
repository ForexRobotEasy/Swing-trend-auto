# Swing Trend Auto

This code is a custom indicator for the MetaTrader 5 platform. It performs trend analysis and draws trendlines based on the specified number of candlesticks. The indicator predicts the exhaustion point of a trend and provides visual representation of the trendlines.

## How It Works

The code consists of several functions and variables:

### Global Variables

- `numberOfCandlesticks`: This variable stores the default value for the number of candlesticks used in calculations.

### Custom Indicator Initialization Function

- `OnInit()`: This function is called when the indicator is initialized. It allows customization of the number of candlesticks used in calculations by calling the `GetNumberOfCandlesticks()` function. Other initialization tasks can be performed in this function.

### Custom Indicator Iteration Function

- `OnCalculate()`: This function is called for each new tick of data. It performs trend analysis and predicts the exhaustion point by calling the `PerformTrendAnalysis()` function. It also draws trendlines based on the specified number of candlesticks by calling the `DrawTrendlines()` function. Other calculations and actions can be performed in this function.

### Custom Functions

- `PerformTrendAnalysis()`: This function performs the actual trend analysis. It takes the `close` array, `rates_total`, and `numberOfCandlesticks` as inputs and returns the exhaustion point of the trend.

- `DrawTrendlines()`: This function draws the trendlines based on the specified number of candlesticks. It takes the `close` array, `rates_total`, and `numberOfCandlesticks` as inputs.

- `GetNumberOfCandlesticks()`: This function provides a customizable user interface for configuring the number of candlesticks used in calculations. It returns the value of the `numberOfCandlesticks` variable.
